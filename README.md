## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Fetch & Match Website Colour Palette](assets/readme-images/fetch&match-color-palette.png)

To reflect the playful theme of Fetch & Match and its adorable dog characters, I designed the website using a cheerful and vibrant color palette. The colour palette was created using the [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) website.

### Typography

'Lobster' from Google Fonts is used for the headings and 'GoodDog' from CDN fonts was used for the body text. These fonts were chosen to evoke a playful, game-like atmosphere.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, ensuring good user experience across various screen sizes.

**Home Page:**

## Features

The website consists of three pages: the home page, the game page and the how-to-play page. 

* **Home Page**

  * The home page features the game title prominently, accompanied by two primary buttons: 'New Game' and 'How to Play'. Clicking 'New Game' takes users directly to the memory game, while 'How to Play' provides a helpful guide. To enhance user interaction, hovering over each button highlights the links.

* **Game Page**
  * At the top of the game page, a timer displays how long it takes the user to complete the game. Beside the timer are two buttons: 'Restart' and 'End Game.' Clicking 'Restart' resets the timer, while 'End Game' returns the user to the home page. Below these controls, users can engage in the memory game by clicking on hidden cards to reveal images. Matching pairs will remain flipped until the game is completed.
  
  * When the user successfully pairs all the cards, a pop-up message will appear, along with the time it took to complete the game. An 'OK' button allows the user to close the pop-up and return to the home page.

* **How to Play Page**
  * On the How to Play page, the user will find an explanation on how the memory game works. A button is provided to navigate back to the home page.

The website adheres to accessibility guidelines, ensuring it is responsive and inclusive for all users.
